Ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) is used in many bio-inspired aquatic systems, such as fish- and tadpole-like robots due to its special characteristics of wet electro-active polymer (EAP). This work proposes a terrestrial walking robot using Ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuators based on Poly-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/ polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/polystyrene sulfuric acid (PSSA) blend membrane. The proposed IPMC actuator is fabricated using a PVDF/PVP/PSSA solution with the mixture ratio of 30/15/55. It can generate higher tip displacement and blocking force at low DC voltages compared with Nafion-based IPMC actuator. A physics-based model is developed for this proposed membrane based-IPMC actuators, which is represented as transfer function relating the input applied voltage and output displacement of IPMC actuators. Two-Degree-of -freedom (2-DOF) and One- Degree-of -freedom (1-DOF) leg structure are used to build different kind of terrestrial walking robots. The kinematic model of these 1-DOF and 2-DOF leg structures are also introduced as modeling framework based on physics-based model output for studying the locomotion of this IPMC leg structure. Simulation results of physics-based model and kinematic model are compared with the empirical response of one and 2-DOF legs. Finally, two different kind of terrestrial walking robots, a robot (18 x 11 x 12, 1.3g) with two 1-DOF IPMC legs and robot (28 x 18 x 16.5 mm, 1.2g) with two 2-DOF IPMC legs and 2 dummy legs have been designed and walked in the terrestrial environment.
